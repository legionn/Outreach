								<p>
                                We were back at Mountview to work with the Grade 4 and 6 students, this time teaching Elm as well! We introduced the students to the 
                                CAT Scan activity which they had a lot of success with. Students impressed us with their 
                                level of creativity both in the graph based adventure app as well as making 2D images in Elm using just shapes. Check out their

                                us later on in the day! We unveiled our official Image 2 Bits app following the interactive introduction to binary numbers and 
                                counting. Continuing to test our beta apps, some interesting storytelling was demonstrated by the students using the graph adventure 
                                game app while we held a challenge to win two of our t-shirts using the coconut search app!

                                This time we outreached to Dundana Elementary Public School where we introduced Grade 4 and 5 students 
                                to the functional language of Elm and the concept of binary numbers and counting in our newly released 
                                iPad app, Image 2 Bits. We continued our beta 
                                test of the graph game creation app and the coconut app and received generous feedback. Thanks for 
                                another successful workshop!

								<h2>Fifth Workshop!</h2>

                                We had Grade 4 and Grade 6 students today once again, at Parkway Public. It was our last workshop
                                held at the school, and what a wonderful way to end off! We continued with Elm, challenging the students
                                to create some awesome images! After the introduction of the <a href="fame.html">Hall of Fame
                                </a>, the quality of the images created has been through the roof! Awesome work Grade 4 and 6 students!

                                We had Grade 4 and Grade 8 students today at Parkway Public with three sections going once again! The 
                                students continued to amaze with their abilities to create awesome 2D pictures and animations in Elm!
                                They were very impressive and creative and can now be found in our <a href="fame.html">Hall Of fame</a> 
                                section. We continued to beta test our two applications, Image2Bits and the graph based game creation 
                                application. We have received a lot of feedback for those apps and will strive to make them better!

                                tutorials and one iPad app beta testing class. Our instructors were so impressed with the creations this
                                time around that we decided to create a separate section on our webpage dedicated to these awesome 
                                creations! Check out the page <a href="fame.html">here</a> or under the Menu, at Hall of Fame!

								<h2>Second Workshop!</h2>
								<p>
                                Our second workshop was held once again at Parkway Public School on May 8th with Grade 4 and 5 students
                                in the Enrichment Program! They were introduced to a revamped website and a new set of tutorials which 	
                                allowed them to create even more amazing creations than before! Students continued our beta test of the 
                                teaching apps; Image 2 Bits, which will hit the app store soon(!), the Coconut linear search app, and 
                                the graph based game devleopment app. We were pleasantly surprised at the skill level of these students
                                and are going to work towards making adjustments to our tutorials to reach out to even more students in 
                                the future!

                            shapes with colours and eventually animations of a heart and beyond. The students also beta tested our 
                            teaching apps; Image 2 Bits, which was developed to teach the concept of binary bits using simple user 
                            created images, a graph based text adventure game designer, as well as a coconut cracking game, designed
