			<h2> 5. Fun Activity! </h2>
			<p>
				The link below will bring you to a page <br>
				with an empty group in code
				<pre><code class="haskell">forms = group []</code></pre>
				for you to put your forms in. <br><br>
				Your task is to combine everything that you just learned <br>
				to make whatever picture that you want! <br><br>
				Look at the Hall of Fame to get some inspiration<br>
				Every picture there was made by someone just like you!<br><br>
